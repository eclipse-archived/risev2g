### About RISE V2G

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/eclipse/risev2g](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/eclipse/risev2g?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

RISE V2G is a **R**eference **I**mplementation **S**upporting the **E**volution of the **V**ehicle-**2**-**G**rid communication interface ISO 15118.
The international standard ISO 15118, entitled "Road vehicles - Vehicle to grid communication interface", defines a digital IP-based communication interface between an electric vehicle (EV) and a charging station (named Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE). It allows for a user-friendly "plug-and-charge" mechanism for authentication, authorisation, billing, and flexible load control based on a wide set of information exchanged between the EV and EVSE.
A rise in the wide application of this standard is essential for reaching the goal of integrating EVs as flexible energy storage devices into a smart grid.


### Mission Statement
The RISE V2G project shall serve as an open source standard-compliant reference implementation and documentation. As such, the objective is to provide a test platform for interoperability testing and to offer an information resource for interested parties. The adoption of a new technology heavily depends on the interoperability of its various implementations. The more tests conducted, the more stable and reliable the developed solution will be.

As the ISO 15118 consists of eight documment parts - with part 1 to 3 defining use cases and requirements for conductive charging, parts 4 and 5 dealing with conformance tests, and parts 6 to 8 specifying use cases and requirements for inductive charging - the RISE V2G project shall evolve to cover all aspects of conductive and inductive charging from the physical layer up to the application layer. However, it requires a lot of work to be done to fulfil this endeavor.
Your assistance would therefore be very appreciated, be it by testing this reference implementation against your own solution - this way uncovering possible bugs or making code optimisation suggestions - or by providing an implementation for yet missing parts.
